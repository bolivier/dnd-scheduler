Schedule events (Dungeons and Dragons)

## Overview

Ever try to schedule events?  It sucks.  People don't use calendars, they're disorganized, and it's a whole mess.  This is to help me organize dates for my Dungeons and Dragons group.  Type in a name, select some days, save it to the "database".  

Future Ideas

* Slack notifications of available times

* Show all times on the calendar (use color variations to show light/dark)

* allow updates 

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
